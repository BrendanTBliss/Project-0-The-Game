User Story:

i. The user clicks on the 'Start Riff' button and is prompted to copy what the guitar does.
ii. One of the five "asdfg" buttons on the screen lights up and one of the "string" buttons lights up and an audible note is generated.
iii. The user will hold down the matching "asdfg" key on their keyboard and click on the matching "string" button with their mouse, generating the same note.
iv. The same "asdfg" button will light up again with the same corresponding "string" button, and then after a second "asdfg" button will light up and another "string" button will light up, and a new note is generated.
v. The user will repeat the same action as before but with the second note. If the wrong note is pressed by the user then they will recieve a strike and a large X will appear on the screen. If they hit the correct note then they will just move on to the next step.
vi. This process is repeated up to 12 times until either a "riff" has been completed or the user recieves 3 strikes. 
vii. If the user can get through these steps without generating three strikes then they will win the game and a "YOU WIN" notification will be generated. If the user gets three strikes the a "YOU LOSE" notification will be generated. 
viii. Throughout this entire process the "Start Riff" button will be available to reset the game.
